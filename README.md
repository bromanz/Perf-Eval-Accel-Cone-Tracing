# Performance Evaluation of Acceleration Structures for Cone Tracing Traversal - Supplemental Materials
This repository contains supplemental materials for the paper 'Performance Evaluation of Acceleration Structures for Cone Tracing Traversal' - to appear in Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques (JCGT).

There is reference shader code in HLSL for GPU cone traversal for k-d trees and two versions of the cone-frustum-AABB intersection for BVH traversal.
