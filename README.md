# Performance Evaluation of Acceleration Structures for Cone Tracing Traversal
## Supplemental Materials
This repository contains supplemental materials for the paper 'Performance Evaluation of Acceleration Structures for Cone Tracing Traversal' - to appear in Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques (JCGT).

There is reference shader code in HLSL for GPU cone traversal for k-d trees and two versions of the cone-frustum-AABB intersection for BVH traversal. Note that in the paper results, we used the basic cone-frustum-AABB intersection. The improved and compressed version of the cone-frustum-AABB test provided a speed up of 1.3-1.5x in our tests. 

For license information, please have a look at the end of the paper.
